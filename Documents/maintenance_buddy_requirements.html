  <h1><code>Maintenance Buddy Requirements</code></h1>
  <p><strong>Team members:</strong><br>Ashton Hull, Jordan Glatz, Daniel Vincent</p>

  <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this document is to define an outline for the requirements of Maintenance Buddy. Maintenance Buddy is a tool in the form of a mobile app that helps keep a complete maintenance log for your vehicle in one easy to access place. Users have the ability to input a multitude of information such as services performed, mileage, dates, receipts, photos, and notes. By doing this a log is created where information on your car can be easily organized. Furthermore, manufacturers provide recommended maintenance schedules based on vehicle make, model, and year, which can be used to keep users accountable. Maintenance Buddy will be a tool that will consistently help in caring for and maintaining your vehicle.</p>
